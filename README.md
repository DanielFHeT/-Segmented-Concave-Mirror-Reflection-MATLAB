# Segmented-Concave-Mirror-Reflection-MATLAB

Concave Mirror Reflection with Segmented Rays in MATLAB - Function for calculating and visualizing reflection angles of parallel rays focused through segmented concave mirrors, ensuring that the reflected rays converge at a consistent focal distance.

## How to Run the Code in MATLAB

1. **Clone the repository**: First, clone the repository to your local machine using Git or download the ZIP file and extract it.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Segmented-Concave-Mirror-Reflection-MATLAB.git
Open MATLAB: Launch MATLAB and navigate to the folder where the code file Concave_segments1_3and2.m is located.

Run the function: In the MATLAB command window, type the following to run the function:

matlab
Copy code
Concave_segments1_3and2;
Provide user inputs: The function will prompt you to enter:

Focal point (focus_x): The x-coordinate of the focal point.
Starting and ending height of parallel rays (height_start, height_end): The range of heights for the parallel rays that will reflect off the mirror, starting from a negative height and ending at a positive height. This range allows the simulation of rays approaching the mirror from different vertical positions, both below and above the horizontal axis.
View the Output: The function will display a graphical plot showing:

The segmented concave mirror.
Incoming parallel rays at different heights.
Reflected rays converging at the focal point.
A plot of focal length as a function of height for the parallel rays.
Requirements
MATLAB installed on your computer.
Basic knowledge of MATLAB to navigate directories and execute functions.
